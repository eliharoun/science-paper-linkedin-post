    3. Only use information from the paper. Don't invent new information.
    4. Highlight the most innovative aspects and practical applications
    5. Include relevant statistics or findings if available
    6. Use 2-4 relevant emojis naturally
    7. Structure with short, scannable paragraphs
    8. End with an engaging question
    9. Add "Thoughts? ðŸ’­" at the end
